// POSTURE: library. `scripts/run-checks.mjs` is its runner and IS `npm run check`;
// `scripts/check-suite.test.mjs` is its drift guard. Both fail the build.
//
// scripts/lib/check-suite.js — THE step list for `npm run check`, and the reachability
// rule that keeps package.json from drifting away from it.
//
// ── WHY THIS EXISTS ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The suite used to be a thirty-link `&&` chain inside package.json's `check` string. `&&` stops
// at the first non-zero exit, so a failing step 21 — `check:mc`, which fails on any machine that
// has not run `bun install` in mission-control/ — silently skipped steps 22 through 30:
//
//     test:probe-readonly  test:pre-tool-use  test:run-gate  test:tier-gate  test:merge-gate
//     test:skill-clamp     test:probe-stop-reason  test:launcher-permissions  test:sandbox
//
// That is every safety-hook test, the gate's own tests, and `test:sandbox` — the check that makes
// "the sandbox is armed" a fact rather than a comment. Measured 2026-08-24: a full run reached
// `check:mc`, exited 1, and printed one failure. Nine checks had not run and nothing said so.
//
// CI never saw it, because ci.yml invokes each script as its own step. `.claude/workflows/qa.js`
// DID see it: its ORACLE runs `npm run check` as a single command and treats the exit code as the
// deterministic floor before any review agent is dispatched. So the floor was skipping the nine
// highest-value checks in the repo — including the tests for the gate itself — and reporting one
// failure, in the one environment where it decides whether a diff proceeds.
//
// Two things live in this one file so that neither can drift from the other:
//
//     STEPS     the ordered suite. The ONE list. package.json's `check` is now just the runner.
//     EXCLUDED  scripts deliberately outside the suite, each carrying the reason in writing.
//
// ── WHAT THE REACHABILITY RULE CANNOT DO ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// `reachable()` finds `npm run <name>` inside script command strings, transitively. A script
// invoked by any other spelling — npm-run-all, a shell loop, or a `node scripts/x.mjs` that
// shells out on its own — is invisible to it and will be reported UNREACHABLE even though
// something runs it. That is the safe direction to be wrong in: the fix is an EXCLUDED entry
// with a reason a human wrote, not a pass granted to something nobody runs.
//
// It also cannot tell you a step is worth running, that its ordering is right, or that it
// asserts anything. It checks wiring, not value.

/**
 * The suite, in execution order. `npm run check` runs every one of these and reports every
 * failure; it does not stop at the first.
 *
 * Ordering intent: the structural and cheap checks come first so a broken tree fails loudly and
 * early in the streamed output, and the slow ones (`check:ledger`, ~45s) sit late so they do not
 * delay the signal from everything else. Ordering is a readability choice only — no step depends
 * on an earlier one having passed. `check:mc` used to sit at position 22 here; see EXCLUDED.

 * their assertive halves already appear as `check:`/`test:` steps (`check:manifest` for
 * `build:manifest`, `check:ledger` for `ledger:verify`, and so on). Governing a generator would
 * demand an EXCLUDED entry for every tool in the repo, which is how a guard becomes noise.
